h2. ADNOrdinalNumberFormatter

A simple subclass of *NSNumberFormatter* that adds an ordinal to a number. e.g. 1st, 2nd, 110th.

It will also strip out any trailing text, so a number can be entered with or without an ordinal.

h2. Usage

There are two branches to this repository. *master* and *production*

h3. master branch

This branch contains the class extension files as well as an Xcode project (version 3.2 and above) that shows how to use the formatter.

This is the branch to use to see how to use the formatter if an example is needed. It as also the branch that further development of the class should be performed on.

h3. production branch

This is the branch that should be used if one wants to use git submodules to use the formatter in other projects. This will only contain the class files themselves without the Xcode project and the example code.

Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from master to production. These are files that are ignored by git and are easily cleaned up by running

bc. git clean -dxf
